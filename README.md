- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BustinMeksmefilgud
I'm a programmer I guess. I'm still learning though. It's been about a year since I've seriously studied programming and I can do some basic Java and stuff. I still need more experience though.
Video Games are fun, I especially enjoy fighting and rythtym games (though I suck at them). I have a dream of helping in creating a video game. I'm not really an idea guy though.
